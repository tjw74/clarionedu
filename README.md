## 📚 Educational Philosophy

### First Principles Approach
We start with fundamental questions: What is money? Why does it exist? This foundation makes everything else clear.

### Progressive Complexity
Each lesson builds upon the previous. No concept is introduced without proper context and preparation.

### Practical Application
Theory without practice is incomplete. Every concept comes with real-world applications and exercises.

### Open Source Philosophy
Knowledge should be free and accessible. Our content embraces Bitcoin's open-source ethos.
